#Call of Duty Korean War

This was the game I made for my final project for the ICS2OG course I took in grade 9 at Richmond Hill High School. It's a 2-D shooter game where your objective is to stay alive while waves of increasingly difficult enemies attack you. There are many features, such as a tutorial boot-camp, randomly generated terrain, and a shop system. The game was heavily inspired by the Call of Duty video game series, and was created using the Pygame module.

I submitted this game on January 25th 2022, but began working on it during the summer of 2021. I got a grade of 100 on assignment, and my teacher kept it as an example for future students.

The music and sound effects in this game were downloaded off of Youtube.
