#Call of Duty Korean War

This was the game I made for my final project for the ICS2OG course I took in grade 9 at Richmond Hill High School. It's a 2-D shooter game where your objective is to stay alive while waves of increasingly difficult enemies attack you. THere are many features, such as a tutorial boot-camp, randomly generated terrain, and a shop system. The game was heavily inspired by the Call of Duty video game series, and was created using the Pygame module.
